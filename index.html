            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists
            to hypothesize the existence of inflation,
            which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in
            the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p class="paragraph">
            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
            named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
            stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
            the world of known physics.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
            hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the
            universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
            instant.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
            look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
            enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those
            particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
            in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew
            a double box around it.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
            they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
            known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to &nbsp;<a href="#cosmic-time">the first
            sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
            astronomers led by John M.
            Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in
            the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#gravitational-waves">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of
            a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of
            a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
            that Dr. Guth was correct."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
            including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
            to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
            itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
            light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal
            patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
            beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into
            frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
            forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
            gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
            waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
