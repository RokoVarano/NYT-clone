            Alan Guth was one of the first physicists
            to hypothesize the existence of inflation,
            which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly in
            the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.
        </p>

        <br><br>

        <p>
            CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist
            named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford,
            stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far beyond
            the world of known physics.
        </p>

        <p>
            He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
            particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
            discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
            hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space
            itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the
            universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
            instant.
        </p>
        <p>
            If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens
            look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped mess. The
            enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and irregularities. Those
            particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit
            in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
            “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew
            a double box around it.
        </p>

        <p>
            On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that
            they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis,
            known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

            Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#cosmic-time">the first
            sliver of cosmic time</a> with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of
            astronomers led by John M.
            Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in
            the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#gravitational-waves">gravitational waves</a> — the signature of
            a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of
            a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought
            smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
            that Dr. Guth was correct."
        </p>

        <p>
            Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many,
            including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
            If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable
            to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang
            itself. It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion
            light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal
            patch in a larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover,
            beyond our own universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into
            frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
        </p>

        <p style="font-weight: bolder">
            'As Big as It Gets'
        </p>

        <p>
            In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies
            forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into
            gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
            waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>

        <p>Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, said,
            “This is huge, as big as it gets.”</p>

        <p>He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in gravitational
        waves.”</p>

        <p>The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that permeates
            space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface of the
            sun.</p>

        <p>Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic
        Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here
        on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.</p>

        <!--insert the picture with the overlapped text-->

        <p>Dr. Kovac said the chance that the results were a fluke was only one in 10 million.</p>

        <p>Dr. Guth, now 67, pronounced himself “bowled over,” saying he had not expected such a definite confirmation
            in his lifetime.</p>

        <p>“With nature, you have to be lucky,” he said. “Apparently we have been lucky.”</p>

        <p>The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’ worth of observations and analysis.
        Eschewing email for fear of a leak, Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few, meeting
        with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was
        sleeping that night in 1979), in his office last week.</p>

        <p>“It was a very special moment, and one we took very seriously as scientists,” said Dr. Kovac, who chose his
        words as carefully as he tended his radio telescopes.</p>


        <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation,
        known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo,
        a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team, knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne to tell
        him the news.</p>

        <!-- Video -->

        <p>Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.</p>

        <p>“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that we
        ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in an
        email.</p>

        <p>Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having news
        like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.</p>

        <p>By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
        astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.</p>
