# New York Times Clone

This is a clone of a New York Times article 
(https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0).
The code was not copied, instead each feature was observed and redeveloped with the knowledge acquired from the lessons
imparted by the program.

The final result is still in development, so no pictures will be posted yet.

It is being developed in plain HTML5 and CSS. some auxiliary tools have been installed as well, such as fonAwesome 
(https://fontawesome.com/).

##Download
